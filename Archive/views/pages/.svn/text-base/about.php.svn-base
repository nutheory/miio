		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>We never worked at Google or Twitter or any cool place like that.</p>
		<p>We’re just a handful of friends with the idea that we could build a site that makes it easy to meet new people that like the same things you do.</p>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>You say what you like. I say what I like. And Miio makes it easy for us to find, follow, share and chat with each other about the stuff that interests us. That’s it.</p>
		<h2>With Miio we can</h2>
		<p>Chat about breaking news, music, TV shows, sports, movies, gadgets, celebrities, or just whatever.</p>
		<p>Share photos, videos, and links.</p>
		<p>Ask questions. Get answers. Write reviews. And a lot <a href="pages/features">more</a>.</p>
		<h2>And?</h2>
		<p>We like it. We’re hoping you do too. Please <a href="signup">sign up</a> and join us.</p>
		<p>Best,</p>

		<p>Team Miio.</p>
		<p>PS We are a private company based in California. You can get in touch with us at info at miio dot com.</p>

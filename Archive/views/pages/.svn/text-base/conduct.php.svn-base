  	</p>
  	<h4>Third-Party Content</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your friends and followers, such as photographs you upload from your camera. This means that you may post 
  		and share original photographs that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or your friends, (ii) are taken by you or your friends, or (iii) are original art or 
  		animation created by you or your friends. In addition, we expect our users to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual property rights of 
  		others. Therefore, in using Miio, you may not:
  	</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>upload or share any photographs, or other Content other than original works that are created by you or another user</li>
  		<li>post or share any Content that infringes upon or violates the copyright, trademarks or other rights of any third party</li>
  		<li>attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques we may employ</li>
  	</ul>
  	<h4>Inappropriate Content</h4>
  	<p>
  		While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point of view, certain kinds of speech simply do not belong in a community like Miio. Therefore, 
  		you may not post or share Content that:

  	<ul>
  		<li>is obscene, pornographic or sexually explicit</li>
  		<li>depicts graphic or gratuitous violence</li>
  		<li>makes threats of any kind or that intimidates, harasses, or bullies anyone</li>
  		<li>is derogatory, demeaning, malicious, defamatory, abusive, offensive or hateful</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>
  		You may not use obscene or pornographic images in either your profile picture or user background.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Unlawful or Harmful Content or Conduct</h4>
  	<p>
  		Although as an online service provider, we are not responsible for the conduct of our users, we want Miio to be a safe place on the internet. Therefore, in using Miio, you may not:

  	<h4>Spam and Abuse</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio strives to protect its users from spam and abuse.  Technical abuse and user abuse is not tolerated on Miio.com, and will result in permanent suspension. 
  		Any accounts engaging in the activities specified below are subject to permanent suspension.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You may not create serial accounts for disruptive or abusive purposes.  Mass account creation will result in suspension of all accounts.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You may not engage in name squatting. Accounts that are inactive for more than 6 months may also be removed without further notice. Some of the factors that we take into account 
  		when determining what conduct is considered to be name squatting are:
  	</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>the number of accounts created</li>
  		<li>creating accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names</li>
  		<li>creating accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts</li>
  		<li>using feeds of third-party content to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>
  		You may not use Miio.com's address book contact importer to send repeat, mass invitations
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Miio, you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You may not publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another user’s browser or computer or to compromise a user’s privacy.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You may not use the Miio service for the purpose of spamming anyone. What constitutes &quot;spamming&quot; will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers. Some of 
  		the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are:
  	</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>If you have followed a large amount of users in a short amount of time</li>
  		<li>If you have followed and unfollowed people in a short time period, particularly by automated means (aggressive follower churn)</li>
  		<li>If you repeatedly follow and unfollow people, whether to build followers or to garner more attention for your profile</li>
  		<li>If you have a small number of followers compared to the amount of people you are following</li>
  		<li>If your updates consist mainly of links, and not personal updates</li>
  		<li>If a large number of people are blocking you</li>
  		<li>The number of spam complaints that have been filed against you</li>
  		<li>If you post duplicate content over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on one account</li>
  		<li>If you post multiple unrelated updates to a trending or popular topic</li>
  		<li>If you send large numbers of duplicate replies</li>
  		<li>If you send large numbers of replies in an attempt to spam a service or link</li>
  		<li>If you repost other user’s content without attribution</li>
  		<li>If you have attempted to "sell" followers, particularly through tactics considered aggressive following or follower churn</li>
  		<li>Using or promoting third-party sites that claim to get you more followers (such as follower trains, sites promising "more followers fast," or any other site 
  			that offers to automatically add followers to your account)</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>
  		We reserve the right to reclaim user names or group names on behalf of individuals or businesses that hold legal claim or trademark on those user names. Accounts 
  		using business names and/or logos to mislead others will be permanently suspended.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Your account may be suspended for Terms of Use violations if any of the above is true; accounts created to replace suspended accounts will be permanently suspended.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Accounts engaging in any of these behaviors may be investigated for abuse.  Accounts under investigation may be removed from Search for quality.  Miio reserves the right 
  		to immediately terminate your account without further notice in the event that, in its judgment, you violate this Code of Conduct or the Terms of Use.

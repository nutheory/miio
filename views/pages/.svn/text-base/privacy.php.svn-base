  	<h4>The Information We Collect</h4>
  	<p>
  		When you visit Miio you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Website use information 
  		collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		When you register with Miio, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, 
  		and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		When you enter Miio, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Miio visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your 
  		browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are 
  		logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it 
  		easier for you to login when you come back to Miio. You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		When you use Miio, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, and transmit information through 
  		various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. When you update information, we usually keep a backup 
  		copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You post User Content (as defined in the Miio <a href="pages/terms">Terms of Use</a>) on the Site at your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your profile 
  		page, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may choose to share your profile 
  		page and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible 
  		for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may 
  		remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Miio is a violation of the Miio Terms of Use and should be reported.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as the name of your 
  		service provider or social network, your username and password and your friend's email address and or mobile telephone number. We will automatically send your friend 
  		a one-time email or text message inviting him or her to visit the site. Miio stores this information to send this one-time invitation, to register a friend connection 
  		if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		By using Miio, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Children Under Age 13</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, 
  		please do not attempt to register for Miio or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under 
  		age 13 may provide any personal information to or on Miio. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without 
  		verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 
  		13, please <a href="pages/contact">contact us</a>.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h4>
  	<p>
  		We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Use of Information Obtained by Miio</h4>
  	<p>
  		When you register with Miio, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people 
  		as specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on Miio. We may occasionally use your name, email address and mobile phone number to send you 
  		notifications regarding new services offered by Miio that we think you may find valuable.
  	</p>
  	<p> 
  		When you use the Miio email invitation form, the people you invite to join you on Miio will be able to see your email address. Profile information is used by Miio 
  		primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Profile information you submit to Miio will be available to users of Miio and to the general public. Your name, and profile picture thumbnail or avatar will be available 
  		in search results across the Miio network and those limited pieces of information may be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends 
  		and others can find you, subscribe to your messages or send a friend request. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Miio may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message, 
  		or someone accepts your request for friendship, you may receive an email alerting you to that fact.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Miio reserves the right to send you notices about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email and text message notifications.
  	</p>
  	<p>	
  		Miio may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio is about sharing information with others while providing you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. Our network 
  		architecture and your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access to your information. We do not provide contact information to third 
  		party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably 
  		necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		When you use Miio, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a friend or subscriber such as personal information, comments, messages, photos, 
  		videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own 
  		risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments, messages, photos, videos, or other items, this information 
  		may become publicly available.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Links</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
  		leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to 
  		information collected by Miio.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Third Party Advertising</h4>
  	<p>
  		Advertisements that appear on Miio are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when 
  		this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to 
  		personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure 
  		the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser 
  		saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Miio does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party 
  		advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Miio unless you choose to share it with them.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Miio and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Changing or Removing Information</h4>
  	<p>
  		Access and control over most personal information on Miio is readily available through the profile editing tools within your Dashboard. Miio users may modify or delete 
  		any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Miio account 
  		may do so within their Dashboard, under the &quot;Setting&quot; entitled &quot;Cancel Account&quot;. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will 
  		not be generally available to members of Miio.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Where you make use of the text message communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Miio, (e.g., sending a personal message to 
  		another Miio user) you can generally remove such communications.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Security</h4>
  	<p>
  		Miio takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive 
  		information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Because email is not recognized as 
  		secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us via email services. If you have any questions about the security of Miio Web Site, 
  		please contact us.
  	</p>
  	<h4>Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions</h4>

  		arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and 
  		clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them 
  		and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through 
  		notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our 
  		current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
